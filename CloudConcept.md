# CIT 114 Week 1
## Intro to Information Technology
### Key Points
1. Infrastructure: the components that make up IT, for example physical components like harware. Can also include software and networks.
2. Development: the process of creating a software. Steps include determining needs, designing, testing, fixing bugs, etc. 
3. Security: Process of keeping designed software (networks, data, etc.) safe from hackers.
4. Data: Both  hardware and software fall under Data. Hardware like HDD and SSD's store data, software is what accesses the data. Forms of data include Word Documents, photos, etc.
5. Learning the basic components of a computer is necessary in order to understand Cloud computing. Some components are not necessary for cloud computing like motherboard. Since cloud is a virtual computer, it is necessary be knowledgable on CPU's, RAM, Storage and GPU's. 
### Quotes
As mentioned in the reading, "A computer may also have more than one CPU, which each have multiple cores. For example, a server with two hexa-core CPUs has a total of 12 processors." I found this piece of information very useful because I did not know that a computer was capable of having more than one CPU! I thought every computer had only one.
